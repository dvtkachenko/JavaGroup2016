Streams support many different kinds of data,
including simple bytes, primitive data types,
localized characters, and objects.
Some streams simply pass on data;
others manipulate and transform the data in useful ways.
No matter how they work internally,
all streams present the same simple model
to programs that use them: A stream is a sequence of data.
